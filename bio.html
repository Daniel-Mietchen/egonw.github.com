      <h2>Biography</h2>
<p>
Egon Willighagen studied Chemistry at the University of Nijmegen in the 
Netherlands (1993-2001) where he did a minor                                     
in organic chemistry at the Department of Supramolecular Chemistry (Prof. R. Nolte)
studying the supramolecular agglomeration of amphiphiles with relation to their     
DNA transfection properties,                                  
and a major in chemometrics at the Deparment of Analytical                          
Chemistry (Prof. L.M.C. Buydens) studying the unsupervised classfication of polymorphic
organic crystal structures.
</p>

<p>
He continued his studies on the relation of representation of molecular knowledge
and machine learning during his PhD at the same Department of Analytical Chemistry
at now-called <a href="http://www.ru.nl/">Radboud University</a> (2002-2006).                            
Taking advantage of his extra-curriculum research in                              
cheminformatics, 
he worked on                                                                      
on methods to optimize the amount of information gained from pattern recognition  
methods in the fields of Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships            
(QSAR),                                     
supervised clustering and prediction of properties of organic crystal             
structures,                                    
the general reduction of error introduced in exchange of chemical                 
data,                                                      
and on improving the reproducibility of data analysis in this field in            
general.                                          
This                                                                              
research was partly performed at the European Bioinformatics Institute in Hinxton
and the nearby Cambridge University in the United Kingdom (2003, 3 months).      
The work resulted in the thesis Representation of Molecules and Molecular         
Systems in Data Analysis and Modeling (2008, ISBN:978-90-9022806-8).                     
</p>

<p>
After his PhD research he continued his efforts on reducing the error introduced
by data aggregation and cheminformatics toolkits during a year at the Cologne University
Bioinformatics Institute in Germany (dr C. Steinbeck)                                            
(2006-2007),                                         
participating the bioinformatics education (Homology Modeling). He then returned        
to The Netherlands and did a year at Wageningen University and Research                 
Centre embedded in the Netherlands Metabolomics Center and worked on use of                      
cheminformatics in accurate metabolite identification (2007-2008).                               
</p>

<p>
During the past year, Willighagen worked in at the Department of Pharmaceutical
Biosciences (Prof. E. Brittebo) strenghtening the cheminformatics knowledge of 
the Bioclipse and Proteochemometrics Group (Prof. J. Wikberg) at Uppsala University.
His research                                                                                 
here focuses on linking his cheminformatics research with pharmaceutical                     
and drug discovery research. The goal here is to make the data modeling more                 
insightful, by upscaling of data analysis by using e-Science                                 
approaches and the use of semantic markup languages   
and ontologies which make it possible to link statistical models          
to external, complementary data sources. This allows linking of patterns
between data types and between domains.
