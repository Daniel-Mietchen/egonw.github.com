Egon Willighagen's Homepage
---------------------------

My homepage is HTML5 + RDFa. At the bottom of the page there are icons, each
of which has a link. The HTML5 and CSS icons lead to validation reports. The
last icon extracts the RDF statements that are embedded in this page.

The slidebar and other interactivity (menus, (un)folding) is created by Lars
Willighagen (see the commits).
